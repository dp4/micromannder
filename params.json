  "body": "### Welcome to micrommander\r\nThis tool is a simple 64 bit file manager for Windows featuring a 100% assembly language source code. The tool shall be a sample for using advanced techniques in assembly language environment, like 64 bit, object orientation and unwindability stack frames.\r\n\r\n### Wait, assembly language? Isn't it dead already?\r\nNo, it's not. While programming languages are getting more and more high level, assembly language is still the base of each and every modern device, smart phone, tablet, desktop or server. If you understand assembly language, each other language will be just a new set of syntax elements and a couple of interesting new concepts.\r\n\r\nThere is probably no useful reason to do a large project in assembly, but every programmer should at least have an idea what is going on under the hood.\r\n\r\n### How will assembly language be able to use modern techniques as OOP?\r\nMost of the common programming paradigms are not a property of the language, but a way _how_ to write source code. The language can give you support to avoid mistakes and make writing easily, however you can still do it on your own.\r\n\r\nThis project features a fully object orientated style, multi threaded working and all the Windows features for x64 programs.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nAuthors want to release this project under open source just as a proof of concept. **Use the tool on your files on your own risk!**\r\n",
